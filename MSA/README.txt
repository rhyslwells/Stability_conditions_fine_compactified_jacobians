Primary file: ...\MSA\Pn.ipynb

Desc: We compute the extention from Pn to Pn+1. We then calculate Pn up to n=6. As the calcuation for P6 is long we break it into parts.

Results of Pn.ipynb are summarised in \results. 

In \Universal\inv_bounds we investigate upper and lower bounds for |P_n|.

In Dimension_Analysis we investigate which MSA functions there exist no universal phi for.

	We then investigate the genus 2 universal stability conditions in particular f2 (MSA) and f3 and follow the documentation there.
