This package has been created by Rhys Wells. It contains analysis of stability conditions of generalised break divisors on a graph and mildly superadditive functions (See Papers).

In both cases we construct non-trival examples and conduct analysis of the results of which are discussed in Rhys's PhD thesis "Combinatorial aspects of the stability space of compactified Jacobians" (See Papers).

------------------------------------------------------------------

In Graph:

We produce examples of weak degree $d$ stability conditions, and for each construct the associated phi stability region P_{ST}^{\sigma_{\Gamma}}.

In MSA:

We construct the set of mildly superadditive functions up to translation, Pn, up to n=6, and conduct analysis on Pn.

In MSA\Dimensional_analysis:

We consider the the combinatorial data that coresponds to a universal fine compactified Jacobian in genus 2. In particular the pairs (f2,f3) of functions and determine all such pairs for n=3,4 (and the translated case). We then determine examples where there exists no universal polarisation.
