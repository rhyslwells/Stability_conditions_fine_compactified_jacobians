    "Hi Nicola,\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall we talked about generating a set $\\{A_{\\Gamma_0} \\} $ for $\\Gamma_0 \\in \\Gamma_{(1)}$ where we obtained $A_{\\Gamma_0}$ from a choice of (D_{T},\\sigma). \n",
    "\n",
    "You asked if there existed a set $\\{A_{\\Gamma_0} \\} $ which glues to give $A_{\\Gamma}$ which saturates to give $|\\sigma_{\\Gamma}^{A_{\\Gamma}}(\\Gamma)|>k(\\Gamma)$. And I said it was easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I misremembered this, in particular the fact that for every $\\Gamma_{0} \\in \\Gamma_{(1)}$ we choose a (D_{T},\\sigma).\n",
    "\n",
    "The example I was thinking of was to choose some $\\Gamma_{0} \\in \\Gamma_{(1)}$ a (D_{T},\\sigma) so that we had for every spanning tree of $\\Gamma$ a divisor. From this we could define $A_{\\Gamma}$ and check its saturation. I did this in the code as it is faster computationally and still gives the weak stability condition case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code I have wrote. For every graph I have considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "I added the require that for every $\\Gamma_{0} \\in \\Gamma_{(1)}$ we choose a (D_{T},\\sigma) and regenerated the $\\{A_{\\Gamma_0} \\} $ for $\\Gamma_0 \\in \\Gamma_{(1)}$ which glue to give $A_\\Gamma$. Computationally, the only $A_{\\Gamma}$ produced by this algorithm are those that saturate to a weak stability condition.\n",
