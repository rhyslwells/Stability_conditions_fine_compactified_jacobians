Here I want to analyse (for a given example) the overlaps of the covering of the top level set $\sigma_{\Gamma}(\Gamma)$  and compare this with the g=1 case.

Using examples i know.

What I will do is:

Chip adding from the codmin 1 layer (chip added already once)

1) straight chip adding from subgraph sets

2) Chip add from my mimimal covers.

3) And Chip adding from the assignment layer.
