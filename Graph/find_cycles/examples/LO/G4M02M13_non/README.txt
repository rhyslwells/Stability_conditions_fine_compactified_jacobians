This folder contains the pkl info for the graph where we fix a tree and divisor 0. And by
the algorithim determined a choice of assignments, the does NOT give a stability condition.

The key part here is that we have a selection of functions A_{\Gamma} that is well defined for a choice of cycle and divisor for each $\Gamma_0 \in \Gamma_{(1)}$.
