Consider the collection of all stability conditions for G.

Graph G:
[('0', '1', 'e1'), ('0', '2', 'e0'), ('0', '5', 'e6'), ('1', '2', 'e2'), ('2', '3', 'e3'), ('3', '4', 'e4'), ('4', '5', 'e5')] 

Subgraphs with maximal necklace:
1. [('0', '1', 'e1'), ('0', '5', 'e6'), ('1', '2', 'e2'), ('2', '3', 'e3'), ('3', '4', 'e4'), ('4', '5', 'e5')]


We study the extensions of a fixed a cycle on the first subgraph (1.).
The order of cycles will correspond to the order of subgraphs given above.


Here is a summary of the cycles on the fixed subgraph
