Folder:genus_1_graphs
Description:Gives stability condntions for genus 1 graphs from a cycle.

Folder: higher_genus_2_graphs
Description:Gets all stability conditions for graphs with middle edge of genus 2 for (5-7)vertices.

Folder:low_genus_2_graphs
Description:Gets all stability conditions for graphs with middle edge of genus 2 up to 4 vertices.

Folder: find_cycles
Description: Obtain and then analyse cycles on subgraphs of the form T \cup e for a given weak stability condition.
