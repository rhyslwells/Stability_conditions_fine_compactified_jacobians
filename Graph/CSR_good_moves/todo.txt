- Fix test_g ...get examples for larger graphs 

- Once done and I have sufficent number of different ones test polytope size, need to unpickle in phi investigation
        and make an area there to check.

- As a consequence we could test for which condition on good move classes allow for commutativity of this process.

Later:
    
- Does there exist good move classes where we can chip-fire by [-1,0,...]?
