For G62 and G63 the dimension for all polytopes given by phi-tree-inequalities is 5.

The polytopes of phi-tree inequalies are combinatoricall isomorphic but not equal (also have same f-vector)

The lbm-phi-polytope is not combinatorically isomorphic 
(and not equal or contain, as in different hyperplane degree g and degree 0) to any phi-tree-polytope.

phi-tree-polytope have larger .radius() than lbm-phi-polytope

The intersection of all phi-tree-polytopes is dimension 5 with common point (0,0,0,0,0,0).

No phi-tree-polytope contains the lbm-phi-polytope.

Note:
Two polytopes are called combinatorially isomorphic if their face lattices are isomorphic.
