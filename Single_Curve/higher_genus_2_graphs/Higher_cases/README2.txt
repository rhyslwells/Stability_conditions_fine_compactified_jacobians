File: Main.ipynb
Description: Produces weak stabiltiies for graphs given in docs (genus 2 with middle edge up to graphs with 7 vertices).

Folder:CSR
Description: Checks that line bundle mutlidegrees for where phi the average fails inequalities, and check they are complete sets of representatives for chip-firing action.

Folder:outputs_bymethod
Description: contains the data of weak stabiltiies produces by Main.ipynb

Folder: phi_inequals
Description: contains analysis of those line bundle multidegrees that fail the phi inequalities (average phi) and determines the polytope dimension 
in particular lbm with empty phi polytope.

Folder:poly_break_divs_analysis
Description:Analyses the phi-polytope of the constant stability condition case (with line bundles mulitdegrees being break divisors).

File:G63 cycle popin
Description: Gives an exampels of the method i used to get all assignments for genus 2 graphs.As associated subcycles (remember to decribe the ordering of spanning trees propely wrt docs).
