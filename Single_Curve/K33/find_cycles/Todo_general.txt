ISSUES:

- What about Z2 action on cycles, see get_leaves.

- Fix out_file


Would like to do:
	- plot subgraphs with cycles too.

Cant do currently:
	- Add assignments onto trees at vertices (cant label vertices)
		- Present tree with assignments nicely plotted

Notes:

For graphs in general we should label in a standardised way:
	- Label a max necklace first 1,..,n
