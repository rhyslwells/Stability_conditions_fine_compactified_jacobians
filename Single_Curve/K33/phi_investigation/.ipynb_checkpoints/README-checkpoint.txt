Folder: phi_inequals
Description: contains analysis of those line bundle multidegrees that fail the phi inequalities (average phi) and determines the polytope dimension 
in particular lbm with empty phi polytope.

Folder:poly_break_divs_analysis
Description:Analyses the phi-polytope of the constant stability condition case (with line bundles mulitdegrees being break divisors).
